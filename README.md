# Car-Rental-Excel

## Problem: 
A car rental company has depots in 4 places (Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, and plymouth). There is an estimated demand for each of the week, except Sunday. Cars can be rented for 1/2/3 days and returned to any depot the next morning. There is a distribution of rental period where 55%, 20% and 25% are of cars are hired for 1, 2 and 3 days respectively. There are marginal costs associated with cars being hired. There is opportunity cost (storage, servicing, etc) for each car a week. 10% of cars returned are damaged, customers will be charged 100$ for damaged cars, and it takes 1 day to repair the car. Only 2 depots have repair capacity and they are limited per day. There are differen prices depending on x-day hire and if it is returned to the same depot or not. The company also can expand the repair capacity at different depots at varying costs. Specific details for each data point can be found within the excel's 'data' column.

## Task: 
Find the optimal number of cars to be placed at each depot every morning, the numbers of cars to transferred to different depot for repairs / meet demand and which depot should be expanded to increase repair capacity. All with the objective of maximising profit.
